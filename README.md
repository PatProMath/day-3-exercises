## Leap year

It turns out that there is actually a set of rules for determining a leap year in the Gregorian Calendar.

Another reminder of man's vanities, but hey, it helps to mark time. So, I can't and shouldn't complain. However, I will be keeping in mind, now more than ever, the blessedness of knowing God's time. A second thing to consider is the beauty of the coincidence of His time and season with man's physical markers. 

### Leap Year Rules
1. Every four years is a leap year, that is, an extra day is added to every 4 years in the month of February.
    Note: Of course, I mean: years evenly divisible by 4, not just any 4 consecutive years. ðŸ™„
2. Except if it is a new century (Meaning, it is evenly divisible by 100).
3. Unless if the century is also evenly divisible by 400.

For this reason, we generally skip new century years when doling out that extra day to every fourth year. 1900, for example, was not a leap year though 1896 and 1904 were leap years.
At the same time, should the new century year be EVENLY divisible by 400, we make an exception and call it a leap year too! Like the year 2000 or the year, 2400 after.
The leap years (counting from end of the last millenium) : 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, ..., 2096, 2104, ..., 2196, 2204, ..., 2296, 2304, ..., 2396, 2400, 2404, ...
